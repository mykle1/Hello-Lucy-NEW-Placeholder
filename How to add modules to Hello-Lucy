1. You can ask me and I'll do it for you, especially if you are not comfortable making code modifications.

2. Again, you can ask me and I'll gladly do it for you.

3. You want to do it yourself? Alrighty then! You'll still have to tell me so I can add it to the repo.

4. Open the sentences.json file in a code editor

You'll see that most of the commands come in pairs.
The easiest way to add your commands would be to copy a pair of HIDE and SHOW commmands.
That's two complete lines including the comma.
Example:

"HIDE ALARM",
"SHOW ALARM",

Now paste it in between an existing pair and the next existing pair. Alphabetically would be nice. :-)
Example:

"HIDE CARDS",
"SHOW CARDS",
"HIDE ALARM",
"SHOW ALARM",
"HIDE CENSUS",
"SHOW CENSUS",

Now edit the one you pasted with the command of your choice so it looks like this.
In this example "CATERING" would be your command.

"HIDE CARDS",
"SHOW CARDS",
"HIDE CATERING",
"SHOW CATERING",
"HIDE CENSUS",
"SHOW CENSUS",

Save the sentences.json file and close.



5. Open the checkCommands.json file in a code editor.

You'll see that the commands come in pairs.
The easiest way to add your commands would be to copy an existing pair.
That's two complete lines including the comma.
Example:

{"wordOne":"SHOW","wordTwo":"ALARM","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"true","moduleName":"MMM-AlarmClock","sendNoti":""},
{"wordOne":"HIDE","wordTwo":"ALARM","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"false","moduleName":"MMM-AlarmClock","sendNoti":""},

Now paste it in between an existing pair and the next existing pair. Alphabetically would be nice. :-)
"wordTwo" MUST match the command you made in the sentences.json file. In this case, CATERING.
Also, you have to change the "moduleName" to the module you want to control, exactly! It is case sensitive.
Example:

{"wordOne":"SHOW","wordTwo":"CARDS","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"true","moduleName":"MMM-CARDS","sendNoti":""},
{"wordOne":"HIDE","wordTwo":"CARDS","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"false","moduleName":"MMM-CARDS","sendNoti":""},

{"wordOne":"SHOW","wordTwo":"CATERING","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"true","moduleName":"MMM-CATERING","sendNoti":""},
{"wordOne":"HIDE","wordTwo":"CATERING","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"false","moduleName":"MMM-CATERING","sendNoti":""},

{"wordOne":"SHOW","wordTwo":"CENSUS","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"true","moduleName":"MMM-Census","sendNoti":""},
{"wordOne":"HIDE","wordTwo":"CENSUS","wordThree":"","wordFour":"","toShow":"false","moduleName":"MMM-Census","sendNoti":""},

Save and close.


6. You should have let me do it for you. :-)

7. Tell me the command and module name and I will add it to the repo. Thanks!
